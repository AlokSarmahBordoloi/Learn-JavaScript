# BASIC THEORY of AJAX 

# AJAX : asynchonous javascript and XML . 
AJAX is not a programming language.
 
- HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request 
 

 - AJAX is a set of "web development techniques"
- Using many web technologies on the "client-side"
 - to create asynchronous web applications


 - with AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve
 - data from a server asynchronusly (in the background)
 - without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page

 - we don't use data in XML(eXtensible Markup Language) format anymore
 - we use JSON now


## we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
 1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
 3. axios (this is third party library)


- AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. 
- This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

#### XML :
- XML is a markup language much like HTML
- XML was designed to store and transport data
-XML was designed to be self-descriptive


#### XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

- XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
- HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
